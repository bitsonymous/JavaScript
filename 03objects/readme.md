# JavaScript Objects

## Introduction
In JavaScript, almost everything is an object. 

- Booleans, Numbers, Strings, Dates, Maths, Regular expressions, Arrays, Functions, and Objects themselves are all objects. 

- The `this` keyword refers to an object, the object it refers to depends on how `this` is being invoked.

## Object Properties
Objects in JavaScript consist of named values, known as properties.

## Object Methods
Methods are actions that can be performed on objects.

Object properties can be primitive values, other objects, or functions.

## Mutability of JavaScript Objects
JavaScript objects are mutable, meaning they are addressed by reference, not by value.

## Built-In Methods
JavaScript provides built-in methods for various tasks. For example, the `toUpperCase()` method can be used to convert a string to uppercase.

## Prototype Inheritance
All JavaScript objects inherit properties and methods from a prototype.

- Date objects inherit from `Date.prototype`.
- Array objects inherit from `Array.prototype`.
- Person objects inherit from `Person.prototype`.

The `Object.prototype` is at the top of the prototype inheritance chain.
